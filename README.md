The lite flavor of Canonical Observability Stack, also called COS Lite, is a light-weight, highly-integrated, Juju-based observability suite running on Kubernetes.

This Juju bundle deploys the stack, consisting of the following interrelated charms:

- [Prometheus](https://charmhub.io/prometheus-k8s) ([source](https://github.com/canonical/prometheus-k8s-operator))
- [Loki](https://charmhub.io/loki-k8s) ([source](https://github.com/canonical/loki-k8s-operator))
- [Alertmanager](https://charmhub.io/alertmanager-k8s) ([source](https://github.com/canonical/alertmanager-k8s-operator))
- [Grafana](https://charmhub.io/grafana-k8s) ([source](https://github.com/canonical/grafana-k8s-operator))
- [Traefik](https://charmhub.io/traefik-k8s) ([source](https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator))
- [Catalogue](https://charmhub.io/catalogue-k8s) ([source](https://github.com/canonical/catalogue-k8s-operator))

This bundle is under development.

## The Vision

The Canonical Observability Stack is the go-to solution for monitoring Canonical appliances when the end user does not already have an established observability stack. COS Lite, being a flavor of the Canonical Observability Stack, is designed for:

* Best-in-class monitoring of software [charmed with Juju](https://juju.is)
* Limited resource consumption
* High integration and out-of-the-box value
* Running on [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/)

With COS Lite now being generally available, we are now working on a highly-available, highly-scalable flavor. It will use many of the same components as COS Lite, plus some additional new ones, and provide the same overall user-experience, and focus on scalability, resilience and broad compatibility with Kubernetes distributions out there.

## Usage
For traefik ingress to work, you may first need to enable the `metallb`
microk8s addon. See the [tutorial] for full details.

The `--trust` option is needed by the charms in the `cos-lite` bundle to be
able to patch their K8s services to:
- use the right ports (see this [Juju limitation](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1936260))
- apply resource limits

Before deploying the bundle you will most likely want to create a dedicated model for it:

```shell
$ juju add-model cos
$ juju switch cos
```

### Deploy from charmhub
You can deploy the bundle from charmhub with:

```shell
$ juju deploy cos-lite --trust
```


### Deploy using this repo
To deploy the bundle from a local file:

```shell
# render bundle with "edge" charms
$ tox -e render-edge

$ juju deploy ./bundle.yaml --trust
```


### Deploy for testing
```shell
tox -e render-edge
juju deploy ./bundle.yaml --trust \
  --overlay overlays/tls-overlay.yaml \
  --overlay overlays/testing-overlay.yaml
```


### Deploy for testing with local charms
```shell
# generate and activate a virtual environment with dependencies
$ tox -e integration --notest
$ source .tox/integration/bin/activate

# render bundle, overriding charm paths
$ ./render_bundle.py bundle.yaml --channel=edge \
  --traefik=$(pwd)/../path/to/traefik.charm \
  --prometheus=$(pwd)/../path/to/prometheus.charm \
  --alertmanager=$(pwd)/../path/to/alertmanager.charm \
  --grafana=$(pwd)/../path/to/grafana.charm \
  --loki=$(pwd)/../path/to/loki.charm

# deploy rendered bundle
$ juju deploy ./bundle.yaml --trust
```


### Overlays
We also make available some [**overlays**](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/bundle-reference) for convenience:

- [`offers`](overlays/offers-overlay.yaml): exposes as
  offers the relation endpoints of the COS Lite charms that are likely to be
  consumed over [cross-model relations].
- [`storage-small`](overlays/storage-small-overlay.yaml):
  provides a setup of the various storages for the COS Lite charms for a small
  setup. Using an overlay for storage is fundamental for a productive setup, as
  you cannot change the amount of storage assigned to the various charms after
  the deployment of COS Lite.
- [`tls`](overlays/tls-overlay.yaml): adds an internal CA to encrypt all
  inter-workload communications.
- [`testing`](overlays/testing-overlay.yaml): adds avalanche relation to
  prometheus and a watchdog alert (always firing) to test prometheus and
  alertmanager.

In order to use the overlays above, you need to:

1. Download the overlays (or clone the repository)
2. Pass the `--overlay <path-to-overlay-file-1> --overlay <path-to-overlay-file-2> ...`
   arguments to the `juju deploy` command

For example, to deploy the COS Lite bundle with the offers overlay, you would do the following:

```sh
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/cos-lite-bundle/main/overlays/offers-overlay.yaml -O
$ juju deploy cos-lite --trust --overlay ./offers-overlay.yaml
```

To use COS Lite with machine charms, see

## Publishing
```shell
$ tox -e render-edge  # creates bundle.yaml
$ charmcraft pack
$ charmcraft upload cos-lite.zip
$ charmcraft release cos-lite --channel=edge --revision=4
```
